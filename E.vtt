00:00.430 --> 00:06.810
In this lecture I'm gonna show you how to connect a USP device to a virtual machine.

00:06.870 --> 00:13.380
As an example I'm going to be connecting a wireless adapter to my Kelly machine but the same method

00:13.380 --> 00:16.860
can be used to connect any US b device.

00:16.890 --> 00:23.160
Now as mentioned in the course requirements you need a wireless adapter for the cracking section of

00:23.160 --> 00:23.910
this course.

00:23.910 --> 00:29.550
So these are the lectures where we're going to show you how to crack the passwords for Wi-Fi networks.

00:29.580 --> 00:34.860
Other than that you can do everything else in the course without a wireless adapter.

00:34.890 --> 00:40.550
What I mean by a wireless adapter is a USB device that connects through your speak to your computer

00:40.980 --> 00:44.570
and it allows you to communicate with wireless networks.

00:44.580 --> 00:50.230
Now most computers and laptops come with a built in wireless card.

00:50.310 --> 00:56.610
The only problem is first of all you can't access built in wireless cards from a virtual machine.

00:56.670 --> 00:58.110
Also even if you can.

00:58.140 --> 01:05.040
So even if you install Kali as a main machine the built in wireless cards are not good for hacking because

01:05.040 --> 01:10.160
we need a powerful adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection.

01:10.290 --> 01:16.380
And we're going to go into what each of these mean but basically the built in wireless adapter does

01:16.380 --> 01:20.930
not support these modes and can't be used for hacking.

01:20.940 --> 01:24.450
That's why I recommend powerful wireless adapters.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.910
They're listed in the course requirements.

01:26.910 --> 01:31.800
And I'm going to list them in the resources of this lecture and you can connect them to Carly like I'm

01:31.800 --> 01:33.540
going to show you right now.

01:33.600 --> 01:39.030
So I already have virtual box open and you just want to click the machine that you want to connect the

01:39.030 --> 01:40.770
adapter to.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.330
We're gonna go to its settings.

01:44.410 --> 01:47.020
We're gonna go to port.

01:47.090 --> 01:56.770
We're gonna go to SB and make sure that your SB is enabled and you want to pick the US b option that

01:56.770 --> 01:58.420
is used by your adapter.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.060
So it's either us B one two or three and for the adapter that I have.

02:03.130 --> 02:09.120
It uses us B to then you want to come here to the plus sign and click on it.

02:10.170 --> 02:15.760
Now you'll see that I have a number of devices that I can attach to the Kelly machine.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.190
Now I still haven't connected the adapter.

02:18.460 --> 02:24.280
So first of all I'm just gonna have a look on the available devices then I'm going to connect the adapter

02:26.270 --> 02:28.640
and I'm going to list the devices again.

02:28.640 --> 02:34.250
I did that because we're assuming that I don't know the name of my adapter because the name that you'll

02:34.250 --> 02:41.540
see here is the name of the chipset that's used inside the adapter so it's not the brand name that you

02:41.540 --> 02:43.950
see on the adapter itself.

02:43.970 --> 02:50.360
So when I click on it now you'll see that I have a new entry called Arturo's and this is actually my

02:50.360 --> 02:51.440
wireless adapter.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.530
It's an alpha AWP as 0 3 6 and h a.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.850
So I'm gonna click on it.

02:58.610 --> 02:59.240
That's it.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.200
Here.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.390
I'm gonna click on.

03:01.410 --> 03:09.900
Okay and that's the adapter added to Kali now before starting my virtual machine I'm going to physically

03:09.900 --> 03:17.960
disconnect my wireless adapter and then I'm gonna connect the adapter once Curly fully loaded.

03:17.970 --> 03:19.230
Now I'm going to started

03:24.000 --> 03:30.010
so I'm gonna put my username which is rude and my password which is T O R OK.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.020
Now Carly is fully loaded.

03:32.070 --> 03:38.860
I'm gonna go and physically connect my wireless adapter and like I said I usually do this just to avoid

03:38.950 --> 03:42.400
any conflicts now wants the adapter is connected.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.330
You want to make sure that it's attached to Carly and to do that.

03:46.330 --> 03:51.030
We're gonna go to the devices menu so we're gonna go all the way to the top.

03:51.070 --> 03:52.610
We're gonna go to devices.

03:52.870 --> 03:59.020
We're gonna go on USP and we're gonna make sure that this adapter right here is checked.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.510
Now sometimes it might not be checked for you.

04:01.510 --> 04:04.570
So click on it to check it for me it's already checked.

04:04.570 --> 04:05.650
So I'm not going to click it.

04:07.820 --> 04:15.830
And to confirm that the adapter is connected we can just go on terminal right here and type if config

04:17.960 --> 04:22.730
this command lists all the interfaces that's connected to the machine.

04:23.300 --> 04:29.500
And as you can see now it's shown an adapter called 9 0 which is the wireless adapter.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.110
So if you have this in here that means your adapter is connected.

04:33.110 --> 04:39.020
If you don't then ask in the discussions and I'll help you through this some adapters are not compatible

04:39.020 --> 04:42.790
with Kelly so that could be the issue or the issue could be something else.

04:44.390 --> 04:51.500
Also now if we go here on the top right you'll see that I have a Wi-Fi option which I can use to connect

04:51.500 --> 04:53.450
to Wi-Fi networks.

04:53.450 --> 04:59.420
Now we don't need to do this because I showed you how to setup and not network and carry already has

04:59.420 --> 05:01.910
Internet access through this not network.

05:01.910 --> 05:07.700
So we only need the wireless adapter to hack into other networks to crack their passwords.
